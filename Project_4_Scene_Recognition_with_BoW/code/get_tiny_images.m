%This feature is inspired by the simple tiny images used as features in 
%  80 million tiny images: a large dataset for non-parametric object and
%  scene recognition. A. Torralba, R. Fergus, W. T. Freeman. IEEE

function image_feats = get_tiny_images(image_paths)
% image_paths is an N x 1 cell array of strings where each string is an
%  image path on the file system.
% image_feats is an N x d matrix of resized and then vectorized tiny
%  images. E.g. if the images are resized to 16x16, d would equal 256.

% To build a tiny image feature, simply resize the original image to a very
% small square resolution, e.g. 16x16. You can either resize the images to
% square while ignoring their aspect ratio or you can crop the center
% square portion out of each image. Making the tiny images zero mean and
% unit length (normalizing them) will increase performance modestly.

% suggested functions: imread, imresize
[m,~]=size(image_paths);
image_feats=zeros(m,256);
for i=1:m
    image_feats(i,:)=imresize(imread(image_paths{i}),[1 256]);
%image(image2); Show image
end

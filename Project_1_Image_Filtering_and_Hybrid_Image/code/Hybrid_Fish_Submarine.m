% Before trying to construct hybrid images, it is suggested that you
% implement my_imfilter.m and then debug it using proj1_test_filtering.m

% Debugging tip: You can split your MATLAB code into cells using "%%"
% comments. The cell containing the cursor has a light yellow background,
% and you can press Ctrl+Enter to run just the code in that cell. This is
% useful when projects get more complex and slow to rerun from scratch

close all; % closes all figures
clear all;
tic;

%% Setup
% read images and convert to floating point format
image1 = im2single(imread('../data/submarine.bmp'));
image2 = im2single(imread('../data/fish.bmp'));

% Several additional test cases are provided for you, but feel free to make
% your own (you'll need to align the images in a photo editor such as
% Photoshop). The hybrid images will differ depending on which image you
% assign as image1 (which will provide the low frequencies) and which image
% you asign as image2 (which will provide the high frequencies)

%% Filtering and Hybrid Image construction
%cutoff_frequency_low = 7; 

%This is the standard deviation, in pixels, of the 
% Gaussian blur that will remove the high frequencies from one image and 
% remove the low frequencies from another image (by subtracting a blurred
% version from the original version). You will want to tune this for every
% image pair to get the best results.
%for i=1:5
%filter_low = fspecial('Gaussian', i*6*2+1, 2*i);

% 'high_frequencies' and then combine them to create 'hybrid_image'

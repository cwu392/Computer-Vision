%% Step 0: Set up parameters, vlfeat, category list, and image paths.

%For this project, you will need to report performance for three
%combinations of features / classifiers. It is suggested you code them in
%this order, as well:
% 1) Tiny image features and nearest neighbor classifier
% 2) Bag of sift features and nearest neighbor classifier
% 3) Bag of sift features and linear SVM classifier
%The starter code is initialized to 'placeholder' just so that the starter
%code does not crash when run unmodified and you can get a preview of how
%results are presented.

%% Step 2: Classify each test image by training and using the appropriate classifier

% for this project.

% thumbnails each time it is called. View the webpage to help interpret
% your classifier performance. Where is it making mistakes? Are the
% confusions reasonable?

% Interpreting your performance with 100 training examples per category:
%  accuracy  =   0 -> Your code is broken (probably not the classifier's
%                     fault! A classifier would have to be amazing to
%                     perform this badly).
%  accuracy ~= .07 -> Your performance is chance. Something is broken or
%                     you ran the starter code unchanged.
%  accuracy ~= .20 -> Rough performance with tiny images and nearest
%                     neighbor classifier. Performance goes up a few
%                     percentage points with K-NN instead of 1-NN.
%  accuracy ~= .20 -> Rough performance with tiny images and linear SVM
%                     classifier. The linear classifiers will have a lot of
%                     trouble trying to separate the classes and may be
%                     unstable (e.g. everything classified to one category)
%  accuracy ~= .50 -> Rough performance with bag of SIFT and nearest
%                     neighbor classifier. Can reach .60 with K-NN and
%                     different distance metrics.
%  accuracy ~= .60 -> You've gotten things roughly correct with bag of
%                     SIFT and a linear SVM classifier.
%  accuracy >= .70 -> You've also tuned your parameters well. E.g. number
%                     of clusters, SVM regularization, number of patches
%                     sampled when building vocabulary, size and step for
%                     dense SIFT features.
%  accuracy >= .80 -> You've added in spatial information somehow or you've
%                     added additional, complementary image features. This
%                     represents state of the art in Lazebnik et al 2006.
%  accuracy >= .85 -> You've done extremely well. This is the state of the
%                     art in the 2010 SUN database paper from fusing many 
%                     features. Don't trust this number unless you actually
%                     measure many random splits.
%  accuracy >= .90 -> You used modern deep features trained on much larger
%                     image databases.
%  accuracy >= .96 -> You can beat a human at this task. This isn't a
%                     realistic number. Some accuracy calculation is broken
%                     or your classifier is cheating and seeing the test
%                     labels.
